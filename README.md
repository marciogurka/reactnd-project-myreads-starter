# MyReads Project

This is my personal project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## How to use it

- Install the project using `yarn install` or `npm install`
- start the development server with `yarn run start` or `npm start`
- Check it live on `http://localhost:3000`;
